[Will AI Make Software Engineers Obsolete? Here's The Reality](https://bootcamps.cs.cmu.edu/blog/will-ai-replace-software-engineers-reality-check)

## Why I Found It Interesting
This article from Carnegie Mellon University explores whether AI will make software engineers obsolete. What I found interesting at first is that it explains how AI, as it advances, will actually enhance the capabilities of developers rather than replace them. It mentions AI excels at repetitive tasks while software engineering requires creativity and problem solving, which I think is a simple but powerful way to explain a worldwide concern in terms that even non-tech people can understand.
I also found it valuable that the article breaks down what AI *can* do versus what humans uniquely contribute. It frames AI as more of an **optimizer than a replacement**, helping developers instead of sabotaging them. For example, user experience design in apps and websites comes from brainstorming, creativity and consumer feedback, which are things that AI cannot fully replicate. I liked how the article emphasizes collaboration, bouncing off ideas, and the human role in shaping technology, showing that software development is not just about writing code, but about creativity and interaction. In our Software Engineering course, we're learning important human skills that this article shows still drive projects while AI just helps with repetitve tasks.
